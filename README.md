# Assignment Title

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains code and analysis for the given assignment. The project involves:

- Using Python for computational tasks.
- Handling and analyzing data using libraries like `pandas`.
- Implementing mathematical computations and data manipulation.

## File Contents
- **`Srividya_Bobba_A1.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing all code and outputs.
- **`Student_List.csv`** (if included): A CSV file required for the analysis.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `math`
  - `pandas`

## Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in any environment that supports `.ipynb` files (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VSCode).
2. Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the code and generate outputs.
3. Ensure that the `Student_List.csv` file is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

## Output
The notebook provides:
- Calculations using mathematical functions.
- Data loaded and analyzed from the `Student_List.csv` file.

## Notes
- If errors occur while loading the CSV file, verify that the file path and name are correct.
- Modify the notebook as needed to suit specific requirements or datasets.
